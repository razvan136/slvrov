## 🙋 What is this?
This is a repo for all clubs under SLV ROV. I'm built using [dev.css](https://devcss.devins.page/), basic HTML, and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## ℹ️ History

This website replaced our Google Sites build. We decided to replace it in favor of a more modern, hands-on, and overall more customizable webpage. In the future, more teams under the SLV ROV organization can have their own subdomain.
